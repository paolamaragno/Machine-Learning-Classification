# Machine Learning Classification task

The aim of the analysis is developing a classification model to predict whether the patient is affected by Breast Cancer based on a set of specific features.
In particular different classification models are fitted on the data to find the best model able to predict the correct response.

The classification models exploited in this work are:
- Logistic Regression;
- Linear Discriminant Analysis;
- Polynomial Linear Discriminant Analysis;
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis;
- KNN (with non standardized data, range normalization and z-score normalization);
- SVM with different kernels.
